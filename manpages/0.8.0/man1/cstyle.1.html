<H2>NAME</H2>

<I>cstyle</I>

- check for some common stylistic errors in C source files
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>cstyle [-chpvCP] [-o constructs] [file...]</B>
<P>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAB"></A>
<P>

<I>cstyle</I>

inspects C source files (*.c and *.h) for common sylistic errors.  It
attempts to check for the cstyle documented in
<I><A HREF="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~lee/06cse480/data/cstyle.ms.pdf">http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~lee/06cse480/data/cstyle.ms.pdf</A></I>.
Note that there is much in that document that
<I>cannot</I>

be checked for; just because your code is <B><A HREF="../man1/cstyle.1.html">cstyle</A>(1)</B> clean does not
mean that you've followed Sun's C style.  <I>Caveat emptor</I>.
<P>

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<P>

The following options are supported:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-c</B>

<DD>
Check continuation line indentation inside of functions.  Sun's C style
states that all statements must be indented to an appropriate tab stop,
and any continuation lines after them must be indented <I>exactly</I> four
spaces from the start line.  This option enables a series of checks
designed to find continuation line problems within functions only.  The
checks have some limitations;  see CONTINUATION CHECKING, below.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-h</B>

<DD>
Performs heuristic checks that are sometimes wrong.  Not generally used.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-p</B>

<DD>
Performs some of the more picky checks.  Includes ANSI #else and #endif
rules, and tries to detect spaces after casts.  Used as part of the
putback checks.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-v</B>

<DD>
Verbose output;  includes the text of the line of error, and, for
<B>-c</B>, the first statement in the current continuation block.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-C</B>

<DD>
Ignore errors in header comments (i.e. block comments starting in the
first column).  Not generally used.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-P</B>

<DD>
Check for use of non-POSIX types.  Historically, types like &quot;u_int&quot; and
&quot;u_long&quot; were used, but they are now deprecated in favor of the POSIX
types uint_t, ulong_t, etc.  This detects any use of the deprecated
types.  Used as part of the putback checks.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-o </B><I>constructs</I>

<DD>
Allow a comma-separated list of additional constructs.  Available
constructs include:
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>doxygen</B>

<DD>
Allow doxygen-style block comments (<B>/**</B> and <B>/*!</B>)
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>splint</B>

<DD>
Allow splint-style lint comments (<B>/*@...@*/</B>)
</DL>
<P>

<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

<P>

The cstyle rule for the OS/Net consolidation is that all new files must
be <B>-pP</B> clean.  For existing files, the following invocations are
run against both the old and new files:
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>cstyle file<DD>
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>cstyle -p file<DD>
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>cstyle -pP file<DD>
</DL>
<P>

If the old file gave no errors for one of the invocations, the new file
must also give no errors.  This way, files can only become more clean.
<P>

</B><A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONTINUATION CHECKING</H2>

<P>

The continuation checker is a reasonably simple state machine that knows
something about how C is laid out, and can match parenthesis, etc. over
multiple lines.  It does have some limitations:
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>1.</B>

<DD>
Preprocessor macros which cause unmatched parenthesis will confuse the
checker for that line.  To fix this, you'll need to make sure that each
branch of the #if statement has balanced parenthesis.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>2.</B>

<DD>
Some <B>cpp</B> macros do not require ;s after them.  Any such macros
*must* be ALL_CAPS; any lower case letters will cause bad output.
</DL>
<P>

The bad output will generally be corrected after the next <B>;</B>,
<B>{</B>, or <B>}</B>.
<P>

Some continuation error messages deserve some additional explanation
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>multiple statements continued over multiple lines</B>

<DD>
A multi-line statement which is not broken at statement
boundaries.  For example:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>if (this_is_a_long_variable == another_variable) a =
<BR>

b + c;
</DL>
<P>

Will trigger this error.  Instead, do:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>if (this_is_a_long_variable == another_variable)
<BR>

a = b + c;
</DL>
</DL>

</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>empty if/for/while body not on its own line</B>

<DD>
For visibility, empty bodies for if, for, and while statements should be
on their own line.  For example:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>while (do_something(&amp;x) == 0);
</DL>
<P>

Will trigger this error.  Instead, do:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>while (do_something(&amp;x) == 0)
<BR>

;
